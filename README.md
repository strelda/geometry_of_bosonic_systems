Mathematica notebooks for the analysis of
- Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model (our reparametrization to better manifest QPT)
- Hartree-Bose (Mean field limit) of LMG model
- Mean field and its geometry in general using xAct
- 2D geometry of a two-level system, as a section of generally parametrized qubit
